Welcome to the MEH.COSMOS (cause its a blend of MEH.NET and COSMOS kernel, get it?), the latest MEH offering, it is a very experimental OS, and in no way should it replace your main one (just yet), so keep that copy of windows, mac or whatever distro of linux you have and stick to running this on a virtual machine, or an external boot disk, eventually we will move everything over from MEH.NET to give a truly standalone MEH system, and a GUI to top it off in time.
